*This privacy policy applies for the variant of NeoStumbler available in Google Play*

NeoStumbler respects your privacy. No data is collected or transmitted from the app without your explicit consent.

The purpose of NeoStumbler is to collect locations of wireless devices, such as Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
This data is collected to reports, which contain an exact location and time where the observation was made
and necessary details about the found devices, such as cell tower identifiers and signal strengths. By default, all
collected reports are only stored locally on the device and will not be transmitted without your consent. If you choose
to send the collected reports to a third-party service, please review their privacy policies first. For more
information, see the *Third-party services* section.

By default, the report collection process is only active when it is explicitly started from the user interface. It is
also possible to collect reports passively in the background when the app is not active. This feature needs access to
the background location permission and has to be explicitly enabled in the settings.

No personally identifiable information, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, is collected by NeoStumbler. If
you choose to use a feature, which interacts with a third-party service, the third-party service provider will see your
IP address and other data you may choose to send them. Please see the *Third-party services* section for more details.

## Third-party services

The collected reports can be sent to a third-party geolocation service. This is only done when there is an endpoint
configured and the *Send reports* button is pressed or the *Send reports automatically* is enabled in the settings.
NeoStumbler has an option to set the endpoint to BeaconDB, but this is done only when explicitly chosen by the user. The
privacy policy of BeaconDB can be found at [this link](https://beacondb.net/privacy/).

Using the map requires fetching map tiles from a third-party service. By default, map tiles are fetched from
OpenStreetMap under their [terms of use](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use).

Using the *fused location provider* utilizes functionality provided by Google Play Services. You can review their
privacy policy at [this link](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/).

## Opt-out

If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not install NeoStumbler and uninstall it if you've already
installed it.

Uninstalling NeoStumbler will delete all collected data on the device.
